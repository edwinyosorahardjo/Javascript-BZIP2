# Disclaimer
I did not write the original bzip2/libbzip2 software and this implementation is not the original bzip2/libbzip2 software that Julian Seward wrote in 6 September 2010

# Demo
https://maciej-wrzesinski.github.io/Javascript-BZIP2/

# Technologies
HTML5, CSS3, javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4

# Description
This is a javascript implementation of BZIP2 algorithm that is based on following steps: The input text should be transformed by Burrows–Wheeler transform, Move To Front algorithm and Huffman algorithm in order. All of this is covered by pretty nice user interface.

# Special thanks
To people who wrote Wikipedia articles and stackoverflow anwsers that helped me greatly in understanding and implementing everything. Also to my high school teacher that long long ago offered me an additional grade if i implemented Huffman algorithm in C++ :) Cheers
